## Important Notes

### Domain Protection
⚠️ Your domain has **Domain Protection** enabled in GoDaddy  
- This is good for security
- It may require identity verification for changes
- You've already added the DNS records, so you're all set!

### Subscription Required
⚠️ Custom domains require an **active Manus subscription**  
- Keep your subscription active to keep the domain working
- If subscription expires, the domain will stop working
- You can reactivate anytime

### Time Remaining
⏳ **Configuration expires in ~1 hour**  
- The verification should complete well before this
- If it doesn't, you can click "Check again" to extend the timer
